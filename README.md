# 2D-Planetary-Orbit-Simulator
A guided project created using Python and Pygame. It visualizes the orbital mechanics of planets around the Sun based on Newtonian physics. The simulation calculates gravitational forces between celestial bodies and updates their positions and velocities in real time, offering a simple yet dynamic representation of planetary motion.

# How to Run the Code

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Install the required library pygame using
pip install pygame


Setup:
- Clone or download the repository.
- Ensure the background image file stars.jpg is in the same directory as the Python script.

Run the Simulation:
- Navigate to the directory containing the script.
- Execute the script using:
python planet.py

- A window will open displaying the simulation. Planets will orbit the Sun with their trajectories dynamically updated.


# Future Modifications that you could try:

1. Add More Planets- Include Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, or even dwarf planets like Pluto.
2. Improve planet textures and visuals using more detailed images or animations.
3. Variable Time Steps: Allow users to adjust the simulation speed.
4. Add functionality to let users add custom planets with specific mass, velocity, and position.
5. Expand the project to include a 3D perspective for more realistic visualization.
